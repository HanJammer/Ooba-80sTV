# Ooba-80sTV
Repository with Oobabooga characters/personas based on the 80's TV Shows.

Personas are described in a way which allows them to impersonate TV show characters closely enough. They will even talk about TV Show related stuff which is not contained in their description.

Example dialogues were generated using _Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored_ model.

# Oobabooga
Oobabooga is a web-ui front end for various Large Language Models, grab it here: info here https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui

To use it you need a reasonably fast CPU or GPU and one of the freely available LLMs you will find here: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke - in general I would suggest using uncensored models as they tend to be more 'intelligent' and creative).
